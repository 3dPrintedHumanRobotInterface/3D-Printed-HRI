# Assembly of a human robot interface for upper limb rehabilitation 
## Overview
The following  instruction consists of a step-by-step  assembly instruction for a 3D-printed 
connection between the human upper limb and and an end-effector of a robot. The 
connection is construct so that it can be mounted and unmounted  very fast at a lot of 
different robots. Moreover, a magnet attachment ensures a high safety for the user. The 
printing instruction can be found here.

## Introduction
Primarily, the human robot connection is used for upper limb rehabilitation. However, it can 
be used for a lot of different tasks, wherever a robot end-effector moves a human upper 
limb. In the following,  each step of the assembly is presented and all parts of the connection 
are considered.

## Required Components and Materials 

### 3D-printed Parts
-  lower splint 
-  upper splint 
-  adapter 
-  plug-in handles 
-  inner loop 
-  outer loop 
-  cylinders 
### Materials 
-  4x screws metal plate 
-  4x screws magnet 
-  velcro fastener/straps 
-  foam 
-  2x M8 screws 
-  metal plate 

## Assembly 
Basically, the connection consists of three parts. That includes an upper, a lower splint and 
an adapter. Furthermore, there is a possibility to use a plug-in handle and cylinder bearing.  

### Splints
The upper and lower splints are 3D-printed and  connected through four straps (figure). The 
human upper limb lays inside these splints. Other possibilities to connect the two splints 
could be elastic bands or simple bands. However, the benefit of the straps is that the 
adaptability to different human upper limbs is higher. The used straps have  length of 150 
mm and a width of 20 mm. Moreover, another possibility is to use longer straps so that only 
two straps are necessary. The upper splint is printed with a platform on th. A metal plate has 
to be mounted on the platform. The metal plate has a dimension of 25 mm x 40 mm x 2 mm 
and has four holes which have to be drilled with a 3 mm drill. The four countersunk screws 
that are needed have a dimension of 4 mm x 16 mm. It is important that the screws are 
lowered so that they are level with the surface of the metal plate. It may be that the screw 
heads are not level to the metal surface, in which case they still need to be ground.

### Adapter

The most important part of the connection is the 3D-printed adapter. On the one hand the 
adapter is the binding piece of the splints and the end-effector of the robot, on the other 
hand it is an important safety characteristic as well. A magnet which is embedded into the 
adapter is connected with the metal plate of the upper splint. If the velocity or force of the 
robot is too high the adapter which is screwed at the end-effector disconnects with the 
splint due to the magnetic attachment.   
Two cylinderhead screws (M6, 30 mm) connect the adapter with the end-effector of the 
robot. The adapter is designed to fit all flanges that have the ISO standard 9409-1-50-4-M6. 
Furthermore, two Neodymium magnets with a total pull force of 32 kg are used. Each of 
them has the dimension of 40 mm x 13.5 mm x 5 mm and two M3 countersunk holes. The 
magnets are mounted with four screws (3 mm x 16 mm).   
Now, the connection can be mounted at an end-effector. 

### Cylinder Bearing
For more flexibility during the rehabilitation, a cylinder bearing was developed. This 
bearing makes a rotation of the forearm possible. The whole cylinder bearing is 3D-printed 
and consists of three parts (inner circle, outer circle and cylinders). To build this 
construction, the inner circle has to be placed in the larger circle. Then, to put the cylinders 
into the bearing, the two circles must be rotated until the two notches in the two parts form 
a circle where the cylinders Ô¨Åt into. Furthermore, a metal plate (40 mm x 30 mm x 2 
mm) hast o be screwed on the platform of the outer circle. If there is a need the 
splint of the inner circle can be equipped with straps. 

###  Handles 
If  required,  a  handle  can  be  optionally  attached  to  both  the  bearing  and  the  connection. The handle plug may still need to be ground to fit the hole in the splint. 
 
### Soft Material 
All splints and handles are equipped with foam. The foam of the upper and lower splint has a 
dimension of 110 mm x 80 mm x 10 mm. Furthermore, the splint of the cylinder bearing has 
foam with the dimension of 85 mm x 90 mm x 10 mm. The foam of the handle for the lower 
splint has a dimension of 40 mm x 40 mm x 10 mm. Finally, the foam of the handle of 
the cylinder bearing has a dimension of 40 mm x 30 mm x 10 mm. All foams are attached 
with double-sided adhesive tape.  
 
###  Safety Strategies 
Even though the magnetic connection is a safety feature, it is recommended to implement a 
stop button and software limits (velocity or force limits) in addition to it. 

### Assembly Summary
Short summary: 
1.  Drilling four holes in the metal plate 
1.  Screw plate with four screws on upper splint 
1.  Connect upper and lower splint with velcro fastener 
1.  Glue foam on the inside of the splints (and the handle) 
1.  Screw magnets into the adapter 
1.  Mount the adapter on the end-effector 
1.  Done 

Cylinder bearing: 
1.  Drilling four holes in the metal plate 
1.  Screw plate with four screws on outer loop 
1.  Rotate inner circle and outer circle so that notches are directly in front of each other. 
1.  Put cylinders inside 
1.  Glue foam on the inside of the splint (and the handle) 
1.  Done 

## Summary
The connection can be realized very easily and cheaply. Furthermore, the design offers a 
simple and very fast assembly on different flanges. Due to the plug-in handle and the 
cylinder bearing, the connection can be used very flexibly. The soft material makes it very 
comfortable for the user and also very safe due to the magnetic connection. This connection 
is not suitable for lower limbs, the splints would have to be enlarged and a stronger magnet 
have to be used.
